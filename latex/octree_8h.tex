\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
struct \hyperlink{structSearchResult}{Search\-Result}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A simple struct for the neighbour search result. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
struct \hyperlink{structKeyIndex}{Key\-Index}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This struct contains the morton key and the index of a particle. a vector of such structs is then sorted by the \char`\"{}key\char`\"{} field. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classOctree}{Octree}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class contains the \hyperlink{classOctree}{Octree} data structure and algorithm for nearest neighbour search of particles. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
