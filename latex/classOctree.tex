\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class contains the \hyperlink{classOctree}{Octree} data structure and algorithm for nearest neighbour search of particles. 

This class is very strongly related with its implementation and the data structure of Default\-Particles class. So do not use this class with the general purpose. This class does not have octree search algorithm. The search algorithm is implemented in Default\-Particles and its subclasses. The member fields starting from \char`\"{}m\-\_\-v\char`\"{} must have same length with Default\-Particles\-::m\-\_\-i\-Num\-Of\-Particles and m\-\_\-i\-Total\-Number\-Of\-Particles. That is, the length of these member field means the total number of particles. Each value of the array represent octree nodes. The location information can be fetched by decoding m\-\_\-v\-Key value. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See Also}
